The task 🛠️

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. The Call Centre Manager is looking for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour.

🟢Customer satisfaction rating

🟢Agent’s performance quadrant
